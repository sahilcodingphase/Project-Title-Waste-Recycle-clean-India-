Waste Recycle is a smart waste management platform where users can report garbage by uploading photos, location (via map), and contact info. Nearby laborers can accept tasks, chat, and get paid for cleaning. Features include real-time updates, status tracking, and map integration.

Waste Recycle is an innovative and user-friendly software platform designed to connect citizens with local laborers or cleaning service providers for efficient and on-demand waste removal and area cleanliness. The platform aims to bridge the gap between waste generation and responsible waste disposal by leveraging geolocation, real-time communication, and community-driven reporting.

Using the platform, any individual can report unclean or garbage-filled areas by uploading a photo, providing an exact location (powered by Map API integration), and optionally adding their contact details for further coordination. Once the report is submitted, registered laborers or waste cleaning personnel in nearby areas can view the request, initiate a chat with the reporter, negotiate payment, and then proceed to clean the site physically.

This promotes not only cleanliness and hygiene in neighborhoods but also creates earning opportunities for daily wage workers.
